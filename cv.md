## About myself:
I've been working as QA since 2020 and it's a really interesting job, but for now, I'm looking to learn programming languages and develop myself more technically. I have a bit of experience in the Python language. For now, I'm looking forward to developing myself as a frontend developer.


## Skills:
* Agile
* Manual Testing
* Python fundamentals
* HTML
* CSS
* Git / GitHub
* Understanding of the web-services (REST/SOAP)


## Code examples:
```
// function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence
function smash (words) {
   return words.join(" ")
}; 
```
